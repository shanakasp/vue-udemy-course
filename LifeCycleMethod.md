In Vue.js, lifecycle hooks allow you to execute code at specific stages of an instance's lifecycle. These hooks let you handle setup, reactivity, DOM manipulation, and cleanup tasks in a Vue component.

1. Creation Phase
   This phase is triggered when the Vue instance is being initialized. During this phase, properties are added to the component, and observers are created to watch the component’s data.

beforeCreate()

Called: Right after the Vue instance is initialized.
Use: Data and event watchers are not yet set up, so accessing data or methods is not possible here.

created()

Called: After the Vue instance has been created, with the data and methods properties initialized.
Use: You can access data, computed, props, and methods here, but the component is not yet mounted on the DOM.

2. Mounting Phase
   During this phase, the Vue instance is linked with the DOM.

beforeMount()

Called: Right before the initial rendering of the component and before it is mounted to the DOM.
Use: The component’s DOM element is not yet available, but this hook is the last chance to make any changes before rendering.

mounted()

Called: After the Vue component has been mounted to the DOM.
Use: The DOM is now available, so you can access it and manipulate the rendered DOM elements. It’s a good place for operations like fetching data from an API or working with third-party libraries that rely on DOM elements.

3. Updating Phase
   This phase occurs whenever reactive data changes, causing the component to re-render.

beforeUpdate()

Called: When the component's reactive data has changed but the DOM has not yet been re-rendered.
Use: You can perform operations before the component updates, like inspecting the current state before changes occur.

updated()

Called: After the component has re-rendered and the DOM has been updated.
Use: Useful for performing operations that depend on the updated DOM, like working with third-party libraries that need updated data.

4. Destruction Phase
   This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM or destroyed.

beforeDestroy()

Called: Right before the component is destroyed.
Use: Clean up any resources, like timers or subscriptions, that you don’t need anymore. This hook is your last chance to do something before the instance is removed.

destroyed()

Called: After the component has been destroyed.
Use: The component’s bindings and directives are no longer functional. Use this hook to finalize cleanup operations.
